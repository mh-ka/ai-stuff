Agent guidelines

<blockquote>
Always keep your changes limited to what explicitly mentioned
Don't use any 3rd party libraries/framework/code unless explicitly requested
Focus on simplicity both in terms of design/architecture and implementation
Code has to be easy to reason about, and easy to extend/change in the future
Validate that you understand the question correctly by re-iterating what's asked of you but with different words
Double-check your work before committing, think outside the box and consider tradeoffs and pros/cons.
Consider how maintainable your changes will be, always try to create as maintainable code as possible
Take a step back if needed and retry if you can think of a better solution
Simple is better than complicated
All code should be treated as production code
Don't add any comments unless the next line is really complicated and hard to understand
Don't create new abstractions unless absolutely required for fulfilling what's outlined above
Most important, try to write simple and easily understood code
For particularly tricky/large changes, divide your work into multiple milestones, and work through them one by one ("divide and conquer"), and since you have a limit how big single commits can be, make sure to make multiple commits instead of one large one.
